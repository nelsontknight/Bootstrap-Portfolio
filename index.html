        <p>My name is Nelson Knight, I'm currently not employed during the time of the Bootcamp. Before I was
          going to school part-time at SLCC and working full-time for my brother for the summer driving a garbage
          truck. Before that I was employed at the University Credit Union, located at the University of Utah campus. I
          was a
          teller there for 4 years and participated in many events to help new arriving students get a bank account that
          would help them in there time at the University.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>While in school I was learning a lot, I also wasnt getting real world skills and
          specific qualifications that the companies are looking for. As I was going to school I was trying to
          get a job that would get me closer into the tech industry and closer to what I wanted to be doing.
          However I found that as nice as coming out of college with a degree in Computer Science would be
          it also would not automatically get me a job.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I started looking at other opportunities to help me get closer to that job I really wanted. I came
          across the Coding Bootcamp in an add as I was scrolling through my Instagram. I sparked my intrest
          but also made me question if it was worth it or not. A week or so later I was talking to a long time
          friend and told him about maybe trying to apply for the Bootcamp. He then started to tell me about a
          co-worker of his went through the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp and raved about how awesome the
          experience was and more importantly helped him get his job. Now three months later here I am trying
          to complete the Bootcamp myself so I can get that job i've wanted to badly.</p>
